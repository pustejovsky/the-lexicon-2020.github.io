# Overview
In this course we address the following questions: 
  * What is the lexicon, what is its content and structure? 
  * What principles determine the functioning of the lexicon as a component of natural language grammar? 
  * What role does lexical information play in linguistic theory? 

We examine how current linguistic frameworks model the interaction between the lexicon and syntax and semantics. In the process, we outline and develop a principled account of lexical structure and design, and a dynamic interpretation of the lexicon within linguistic theory. The resulting view is data-oriented while making a strong claim for specific, generatively oriented principles characterizing the behavior of words and the concepts they denote.
